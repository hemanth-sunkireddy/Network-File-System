# Storage server Documentation  

### How to run 
1. Run make in storage_server directory. 
2. Run ./storage_server 

### Initialisation of storage servers.
1. Taking first storage number as 5000. And then each storage server incremented by 1. ( 5000, 5001, 5002,...)
2. For now, IP address is same for all. (127.0.0.1) - implementing different ip's now. 
3. For Now, Fixed storage servers count is 4. (Initialised 4 storage servers.)
4. And I am creating four folders for 4 storage servers in the root directory of storage_server to seperate them easily. 
5. Added basic code of initialisation of all storage servers. 
6. Implementing routings. (Working on this.)
